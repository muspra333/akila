        <H1><B><U><I>ABOUT GORILLA</I></U></B></H1>
       <P>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.<BR>
             The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies.<BR>
                 The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included,<BR>
                     and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</P> 
                     <H2><B><U><I>LIFE SPAN OF AN GORILLA</I></U></B></H2>
                     <P>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex.<BR>
                         They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. <BR>
                            Gorillas tend to live 35 TO 40 years in the wild.<BR></P>
                                <H3><B><U><I>WHAT DOSE THE GORILLA EAT??</I></U></B></H3>
                                <P>They can eat all day long. Mountain gorillas spend about a quarter of their day eating, mainly plants.<BR>
                                     Around 85% of their diet is made up of leaves, shoots and stems, but gorillas can also eat larvae, snails, ants, and even roots, barks and rotting wood a good source of sodium/salt.</P>

                                     <H4><I><B><U>How smart is a gorilla?</U></B></I></H4>
                                     <P>Gorillas are considered highly intelligent. A few individuals in captivity, such as Koko, have been taught a subset of sign language.<BR>
                                         Like the other great apes, gorillas can laugh, grieve, have "rich emotional lives", develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and think about the past and future.</P>
                                         <H5><B><U><I>Are gorillas 99% human?</I></U></B></H5>
                                         <P>The recent sequencing of the gorilla, chimpanzee and bonobo genomes confirms that supposition and provides a clearer view of how we are connected:<BR>
                                             chimps and bonobos in particular take pride of place as our nearest living relatives, sharing approximately 99 percent of our DNA, with gorillas trailing at 98 percent.</P>
                                             <P>Gorilla strength is estimated to be about 10 times their body weight.<BR>
                                                 Fully grown silverbacks are in actually stronger than 20 adult humans combined.<BR>
                                                     A Silverback gorilla can lift 4,000 lb (1,810 kg) on a bench press, while a well-trained man can only lift up to 885 lb (401.5 kg.</P>
                                                     <H6><I><U><B>Do gorillas accept humans?</B></U></I></H6>
                                                     <P>These gorillas are habituated to the presence of humans, <BR>
                                                        which means that they tolerate us without modifying their behaviors,<BR>
                                                             seeing us as a neutral part of their environment.</P>

                                                             <P>Certain reptiles such as chameleons and caterpillars are what are gorillas scared/afraid of.<BR>
                                                                 They are also afraid of water and will cross streams only if they can do so without getting wet,<BR>
                                                                     such as by crossing over fallen logs, and dislike rain.</P>
                                                                     <H8><I><B><U>What makes a gorilla angry?</U></B></I></H8>

                                                                        However, they do so only when they feel threatened or when a silverback from another group attempts to steal one of the females. <BR>
                                                                            Gorillas will first attempt to warn off an intruder by making loud grunts and tearing down vegetation</P>
